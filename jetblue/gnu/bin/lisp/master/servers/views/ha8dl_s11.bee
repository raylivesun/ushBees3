/* 1.5 Adaptations of RME
Implementing RME, being inspired by RME and coping with the challenges that
come with this new approach evidently require that adaptations are made to RME,
in order to make it workable in a countryâ€™s educational context and system. In South
Africa, despite the common grounds in general ideas about mathematics education
such adaptations were, according to Julie and Gierdien (Chap. 5), necessary because
of the tension between the content of the RME-based materials and the â€˜legitimate
school mathematicsâ€™, that is, the mathematics that is valued in high-stakes examina-
tions. There is a strong demand for proximity of the used RME resources. Teachers
wanted to be assured of the immediate relevance of innovations to their current
responsibilities and accountabilities with respect to the curriculum and accompa-
nying activities such as examinations. As a result of this requirement it happened
that RME-based modules were not disseminated further after trying them out in the
classroom. Such was the case with a module on vision geometry. This particular
module was chosen due to problems students in South Africa have with geometry
and because the topic of vision geometry was quite in line with the RME perspective
to provide students with activities where they can experience mathematics. However,
even though the activities in this module were found enjoyable and not above the
abilities of the students, after a few trials and notwithstanding some revisions to make
it closer to the curriculum, it was not further used.
